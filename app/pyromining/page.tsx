                        <p>
                            Pyro Mining is a plugin that adds a ton of new content to the most basic of tasks. With this addon, even just mining redstone ore can be super rewarding! You can dig up rare minerals from the ores you mine, uncover and reveal hidden artifacts in the ground, upgrade a singularity to increase your mining capabilities, and fight bosses to upgrade your pickaxes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Getting started is as simple as picking up a pickaxe and getting headed into the mines. Once you're in there, just go to town on some ores! You'll find Fluxes, Gemstones, and Mysterious Dust in certain ores, the first two of which can be sold for money. Mysterious Dust has a bunch of uses though! Once you make a refinery, you can refine your Mysterious Dust into fun new items that you can get more variety of once you level up by mining! For example, one thing you can get from the start is Rune Dust, which you can use to summon Rune Guardians to get Runes to upgrade your Singularity!                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Artifacts are gotten in a similar way. Once you get mining for a good bit, you might have built up some artifacts. Right click on them to uncover them, and run the command /mine artifacts to identify what's inside with up to 5 at a time! They have all sorts of goodies inside depending on what tier of artifact you have, ranging from more ores to fossils for upgrading your pickaxe to Requiem Orbs!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Requiem Orbs are just the start of a bigger cause. With enough of the right fossils from before, you can get a full Vessel. Once you summon this Vessel, you have to use the right Requiem Orbs to kill it and get a very strong, permanent upgrade to your pickaxe! For example, Seraph's Vessel gives you a lot more experience from mining ores! These can level up multiple times, leading to a very high power cap.

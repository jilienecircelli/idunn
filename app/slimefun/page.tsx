                            Slimefun4 is an absolutely massive modpack with so many capabilities it would be hard to list them all here. You've really got it all: massive automation, transcribing every survival-obtainable block into a journal, making runes so you don't lose your items on death, nuclear reactors, magic wands to launch you in the air, and even getting faster oxidized copper. That's just touching the surface of what you can do.

                            Getting started just needs gravel and some multiblocks, but the latter are easy to find in the ingame guide, which you can obtain by doing /sf guide! That'll give you a neat little book that you can use experience on to unlock the hundreds of new items contained in this plugin! You really can't overstate how much it changes the game into making it feel like a modpack without any real mods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you refine some gravel into ore dusts through a couple multiblocks, maybe gather a good bit of coal, you can get new ingots and make a neat electrical system that's not too hard to set up. A lot of it can be figured out by asking others, looking at tooltips, or even just experimenting to see what works! That's where the real fun lies.

                            You can delve as deep as you want into any aspect of it! As an example, travel. Want to just make an elemental wand to get around with an elytra faster and that's it? Sure! Want to make machinery and use resources from the plugin to make a multitool so it uses power instead of food? That works too! Want to get deep into the GPS system and generate a load of power to charge it so you can teleport anywhere? That's all up to you!!! Enjoy it however you want!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's even extra sub-plugins to go along with Slimefun4 here on Idunn! With things like Relics of Cthonia, you can find new things to trade with piglins for Slimefun items or Simple Storage, which is a very power-intensive (to craft) storage option that works like a modded storage system, along with a few others!
